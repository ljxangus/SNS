# Kivy

### SNSAPP

*This is a prototype kivy app based on SNSAPI.*
You can read cross-platform information in one app.

### How to use this app?
> Right now, I haven't packed the APP as APK, so the way to install the app is not that easy. But don't worry, it is still so simple for you to use it.
 
* Install kivy launcher in your phone/PC/iPhone
> [Install Link on Android APP store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame)
* Put all the files download from github into your Kivy launcher location(i.e.`sdcard0/kivy`)
Tips: make sure that there is a file `android.txt` in the location `sdcard0/kivy/SNS/`
* Launch Kivy Launcher on your devices
* Click `SNSAPP`

### TODO:
We will further explore more functions and add them to the app. Also, we will do a ranking job in the future version.
